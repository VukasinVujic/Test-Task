1. The animation under the title "This is Digibiz24" for the 3 elements is confusing and at first I thought 
it is for scrolling which I did, and just moving it up and down makes me feel as if I made a scroll there by accident
2. The CTA button should be the same color as other text on the page, get Your 30-Day Free Trial doesn't pop up visually, also make the text bolder and larger.
3. The nav bar doesn't follow the user when he starts to scroll down, it should follow him as he does.
